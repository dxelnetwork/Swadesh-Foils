Build a single-file inline HTML "Coming Soon" landing page with a parallax carousel background (dark factory photos). Requirements:

1. File & deliverable
   - Single HTML file (no build step). All CSS and JS inline or in <style> / <script> blocks.
   - Lightweight, responsive and mobile-first. No external frameworks required (vanilla JS + CSS).
   - Accessible (semantic HTML, ARIA labels, keyboard navigation).

2. Visual & UX
   - Full-viewport hero with a parallax carousel of dark, atmospheric factory photos (use AI-generated attractive images). Replace any placeholder/current photo with these AI-generated photos.
   - Carousel behavior:
     • Parallax depth effect on scroll and mouse move.
     • Smooth "melt" crossfade transition between slides (a slow, soft dissolve that looks like melting).
     • Autoplay with configurable interval, pause on hover/focus, arrow navigation, and dot indicators.
     • Subtle motion performance optimizations (will-change, transform: translate3d).
   - Overlay: centered vertical stack with:
     • Top: small label or line (optional decorative divider).
     • Big heading: "Coming Soon"
     • Under the heading, company name: "Swadesh Foils Ltd"
         - Text color: CMYK C100 M20 Y0 K0 (approx. hex #00CCFF). Use the CMYK note in comments.
         - Increase company name font-size noticeably (desktop ~2.5rem or larger), responsive scaling on smaller screens.
     • Countdown timer (days : hours : minutes : seconds) with clear labels, accessible to screen readers.
   - Typography: choose a clean geometric sans-serif (system stack or Google font fallback). Make headings bold and legible.
   - Color accents:
     • Link color for all footer/social links: #14BF98.
     • Ensure sufficient contrast for text over dark photos (use semi-opaque overlay gradient if needed).

3. Footer content (left-aligned or centered as design dictates)
   - Developer: DXEL Network — link to https://dxel.net (open in new tab)
   - Contact email: hello@dxel.net (mailto:)
   - Phone: +1 (347) 669-1213 (tel:)
   - Address: New York, United States
   - Social icons: Twitter (X) https://x.com/dxelnetwork and GitHub https://github.com/dxelnetwork/ — icons should be visible and follow the link color #14BF98.
   - Footer should be responsive, accessible, and include aria-labels for contact items.

4. Imagery & replacement
   - Use AI-generated dark factory photos for carousel background. Provide a clear mechanism in the code to replace current photo(s) easily (data attributes or a single array of image URLs).
   - Smoothly replace current main photo with the AI-generated one using the melt crossfade animation on load if a different photo is present.

5. Behavior & extras
   - Countdown target: allow a placeholder target date (e.g., data-launch="2025-12-01T12:00:00Z") so I can change it easily.
   - Graceful fallback: if JS disabled, show static "Coming Soon — launch date: YYYY-MM-DD" and a fallback background image.
   - CSS-only print-friendly styles (hide animation).
   - Small script to handle live countdown, pause/resume carousel, keyboard left/right for navigation, and reduced-motion respect (`prefers-reduced-motion`).

6. Developer notes/comments in the HTML
   - Include an inline comment that C100 M20 Y0 K0 ≈ #00CCFF and that color can be adjusted.
   - Add usage comments for replacing images and adjusting launch date, autoplay interval, and melt duration.

7. Deliverable example structure (in the single file)
   - <!doctype html>
   - <head> meta, title, responsive meta tag, minimal inline CSS -->
   - <body> hero with carousel, overlay content, countdown, footer
   - inline <script> for carousel, countdown, accessibility handlers
   - Inline comments showing where to replace AI images and settings.

Make the design dark, modern, minimal, and professional — focused on an industrial aesthetic for "Swadesh Foils Ltd". Ensure all links open in new tabs, and use #14BF98 for link color and #00CCFF (C100 M20 Y0 K0) for the company name text. Provide fully working code in the single HTML file so I can drop it on a server and it works immediately.
